# min2Hub API
min2Hub web app API
Requires express & mysql modules

    `npm i express`
    `npm i mysql`

For this API to work, you need to turn on the server and enable the ports used by the different applications. In this case, port 3001 was used for the proxy and port 3306 for the connection to mySQL running on localhost.
 
In order to turn on the server you need to enter the `npm start` command while inside the *server* folder
